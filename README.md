# `HeartRei Therapies v2`

A new and improved website to replace the existing static version of the HeartRei Therapies website.

## Objectives

- Create a dynamic website, where content can be pulled from an external source such as a headless CMS
- Improve the consistency and responsiveness by using a CSS library

## What I Learned

- Improved knowledge of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), this is my first project after finishing a course.
- Introduced the [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) component CSS library to my skill set.
- How to handle React forms using [Formik](https://formik.org/), with validation using yup.

## Future plans

- Add active link highlighting to the main navigation.
- Add animations.
- Extract additional content to Contentful. Particularly the about page, so that this can be updated independent of the code base.
- Currently, the next/image component does not work well with the Chakra Image component. Image optimization has been carried out manually.
- Implement a Captcha solution for the contact form.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
